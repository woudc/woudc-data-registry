# WOUDC Data Registry Setup Instructions

This guide provides step by step instructions to setup and display WOUDC data 
within a queryable Elasticsearch system. Populating the Elasticsearch system with 
data allows for access from the WOUDC API system which gives various applications 
access to the data. The WOUDC UI system then accesses  the WOUDC API system
and displays the data to the public through various plots, graphs and tables.  

* Provided paths are relative to the root of the cloned repository on disk.

# Environment setup and activation
In this section steps are provided to fetch the WOUDC Data Registry codebase from 
github and setup the python environment it uses. Two methods to setup the 
WOUDC Data Registry virtualenv are listed below. This python environment 
allows the user to run commands specific to WOUDC Data Registry.

* Disk space is required for storing the codebase
```bash
# Activate python virtualenv without conda: 
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages woudc-data-registry
cd /woudc-data-registry
source bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/woudc/woudc-data-registry.git

# Activate python virtualenv using conda
git clone https://github.com/woudc/woudc-data-registry.git
cd to the conda install location
source bin/activate woudc-data-registry
```
# Data Registry Install and Configuration 
The `python setup.py install` command installs the codebase into the
system. After changes are made to the codebase, this command must be
run in order to integrate the changes into the system. 

WOUDC Data Registry uses a .yml file for configuration. This file 
tells the Registry where to find the various files/components that 
are required for Registry operations. 
```
# With conda setup
cd /woudc-data-registry

# Without conda setup
cd /woudc-data-registry/woudc-data-registry

# Install WOUDC Data Registry codebase
python setup.py install
 
# Setup/edit config file: 
vim foo.env

# Run contents of config file
. foo.env
```
# Table and Elasticsearch initialization
The `woudc-data-registry admin registry setup` command generates tables within the WOUDC Data Registry
psql database specified in the config (.yml) file. The tables are all empty
at the moment and will be filled during the migration and data ingest steps.

The `woudc-data-registry admin search setup` command works similarly to the registry setup
command except it generates indices within the Elasticsearch component instead. 
The Elasticsearch component setup occurs the URL specified in the config(.yml) file. 
All the indices are empty at the moment and will be filled during the sync step.

```
# Initialize the WOUDC Data Registry tables
woudc-data-registry admin registry setup

# Initialize the Elasticsearch component
woudc-data-registry admin search setup
```
# Data Migration from Woudc Archive
The migration/bps directory provides migration scripts that are used to extract
metadata from the WOUDC Backend Processing System (BPS) in support of
WOUDC Data Registry initialization and metadata ingest.

The WOUDC Data Registry initialization process requires a series of metadata
files. Some of them are provided along with the WOUDC Data Registry code.
The remaining required files are generated by running `get-bps-metadata.sh`.

`get-bps-metadata.sh` extracts metadata in CSV format as well as download
the offical WMO country list.  These files can then be used as part of the
initialization process as follows:

To complete the migration access to WOUDC Archive database is required. Disk Space
is also required to store the generated extcsv files.
```
# With conda setup
cd /woudc-data-registry/migration/bps

# Without conda setup
cd /woudc-data-registry/woudc-data-registry/migration/bps

# Setup/edit migration config file
vim migration.env

# Run contents of migration.env
. migration.env

# Generate WOUDC Data Registry extCSV files with conda setup
get-bps-metadata.sh -o /woudc-data-registry/data 

# Generate WOUDC Data Registry extCSV files without conda setup
get-bps-metadata.sh -o /woudc-data-registry/woudc-data-registry/data

# Initalize WOUDC Data Registry with conda setup
woudc-data-registry admin init -d /woudc-data-registry/data

# Initalize WOUDC Data Registry without conda setup
woudc-data-registry admin init -d /woudc-data-registry/woudc-data-registry/data
```
# WOUDC data file ingest and sync into WOUDC Data Registry
Environmental agencies around the world collect WOUDC data and generate/submit WOUDC extcsv files.
These files can then be ingested and stored in the WOUDC Data Registry system. The 
`woudc-data-registry data ingest /path/to/dir` command will ingest all files contained in the
/path/to/dir directory and subdirectories. The ingest command contains several options including 
skipping yes prompts and generating an operator report. 

* Details on these options can be found at https://github.com/woudc/woudc-data-registry

The `woudc-data-registry admin search sync` command syncs the contents of the WOUDC Data
Registry database to the Elasticsearch component. After this command has been run, the data will be 
queryable through Elasticsearch queries and accessible from the WOUDC API component.
```

# Ingest files into WOUDC Data Registry
woudc-data-registry data ingest /path/to/dir

# Sync contents of the WOUDC Data Registry database to Elasticsearch
woudc-data-registry admin search sync
