# WOUDC BPS migration

This directory provides migration scripts that are used to extract
metadata from the WOUDC Backend Processing System (BPS) in support of
WOUDC Data Registry initialization and metadata ingest.

The WOUDC Data Registry initialization process requires a series of metadata
files. Some of them are provided along with the WOUDC Data Registry code.
The remaining required files are generated by running `get-bps-metadata.sh`.

`get-bps-metadata.sh` extracts metadata in CSV format as well as download
the offical WMO country list.  These files can then be used as part of the
initialization process as follows:

```bash
vi migration.env  # configure database connection information

# extract BPS metadata
get-bps-metadata.sh -o /path/to/output-dir/

# initialize WOUDC Data Registry
woudc-data-registry admin init -d /path/to/output-dir/
```
